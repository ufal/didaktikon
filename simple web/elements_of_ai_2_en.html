      <h2>Elements of AI 2.0 (introduction to artificial intelligence)</h2>
      <br>
     


<div style="text-align: left;">
  <p>
AI, artificial intelligence, smart devices, machine learning… We hear these words more and more often. AI is penetrating many areas of human activity — from drug development to partner selection. The course “Elements of AI 2.0” is designed for complete beginners in the field of AI and introduces students to the topic without requiring any programming.
  </p>

  <p>
Students of Charles University can register for this course as an elective under
<a href="https://is.cuni.cz/studium/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&kod=NAIL141" class="yellow">NAIL141</a>
and, after successful completion, receive 3 credits.
This is a true beginner-level course, intended for all Charles University students (primarily outside the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics).
  </p>

  <p>
The course consists of four parts: an online course (Elements of AI), attendance at one in-person lecture, one homework assignment, and a final workshop.
  </p>

  <p>
The course capacity is limited (due to personnel constraints). You can also
complete the online course and attend the lectures even without enrolling into
the NAIL141 course (without receiving credits).
  </p>

  <p>
The information below applies to the Winter Semester 2025/2026; instructions for the Summer Semester 2025/2026 will be published at the start of that term (some things may change depending on the evaluation of the winter semester).

          (in which you will upload your course completion certificate).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      By attending a lecture of your choice, you will broaden your understanding of AI in a specific discipline (e.g., AI in healthcare, law, transport, or drone applications).  
      Only one lecture is required (though you are welcome to attend more).
      <ul>
        <li>
          You may choose a lecture freely, as long as it is part of a
          university course (e.g., AI in Context; but these are mostly in
          Czech), an academic conference, or AI Days.  
          If you wish to attend a different lecture, please contact us first to confirm it’s suitable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lectures titled <em>AI in Context</em> take place on some Thursdays at 17:30 at MFF UK, Malostranské náměstí 25, Prague 1.  
          More info under <a href="aivk_vyuka.html">Lectures</a>.
        </li>
        <li>Attending online lectures is also acceptable.</li>
        <li>
          Between November 3–16, many AI-related lectures and events take place across the Czech Republic as part of the
          <a href="https://www.dny.ai/">AI Days</a> festival.
          Attendance at one of these lectures also counts toward this course requirement.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please attend at least one AI-related lecture by December 19, 2025, and fill out the feedback form
          <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=2naS4DT5hkC_CIgWogQUon-HfqrM4h9JjjIfnQRr6CpUM0VOSDczOVJNS0NVRTlGUDYwS1pWN1I0Ry4u">AI_related_lecture</a>
          within 7 days after the lecture (later submissions will not be accepted).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      The homework assignment is a short reflection video (2–3 minutes).
      <ul>
        <li>
          The format of the video is up to your creativity.  
          It should present AI in the context of your field of study (or a related one).  
          Ideally, it should be inspired by the lecture you attended, but that is not mandatory.
        </li>
        <li>
          The video should clearly state a question you aim to answer — for example:  
          AI in medicine: What are the pitfalls of using smartwatch data?  
          AI in journalism: Does it make sense to employ journalists focused on stock markets?  
          <li>Present your question first, then provide your own reasoned answer.  
          <li>Your video will be shared only with a small group (approx. 5–7 students) as part of the workshop; it will not be shown publicly.  
          As preparation for the workshop, you will watch the videos of your groupmates and provide feedback.  
          <li>Please upload your video privately on YouTube and submit the link through the
          <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=2naS4DT5hkC_CIgWogQUon-HfqrM4h9JjjIfnQRr6CpUMk1OMjlRSklFUktaWEpBU000Q0NWTVE5NS4u">Homework_video form</a>
          by December 31, 2025.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      The final workshop serves to consolidate your knowledge and present your homework.
      <ul>
        <li>During the workshop, students will learn about topics explored by their peers, gaining insight into other areas of human activity.</li>
        <li>Workshop dates will be announced here and in the SIS by the end of November.</li>
        <li>Workshops will be held in Prague, likely during the examination period.</li>
        <li>Details about the format and content of the final workshop will be provided during the semester.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
This is the first time we are offering the course in this format, so we kindly ask for your patience and understanding if something is unclear. Thank you.
