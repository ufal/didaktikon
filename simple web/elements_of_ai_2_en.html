      <h2>Elements of AI 2.0 (introduction to artificial intelligence)</h2>
      <br>
     
      <hr>
      <p><strong>This course is now offered only in Czech language!</strong>
      Feel free to take the online course in English, but you cannot get
      credits for that.
      <br>The information below was valid for winter term 2025/2026 when the
      course was also offered in English.
      <hr>


<div style="text-align: left;">
  <p>
AI, artificial intelligence, smart devices, machine learning… We hear these words more and more often. AI is penetrating many areas of human activity — from drug development to partner selection. The course “Elements of AI 2.0” is designed for complete beginners in the field of AI and introduces students to the topic without requiring any programming.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <p>
You can participate in the online course *Elements of AI* for free without registering in SIS.  
Simply register at <a href="https://www.elementsofai.cz/" class="yellow">https://www.elementsofai.cz/</a>, complete the course, and obtain a certificate of completion (but you will not receive university credits).  
The course is open to all students and the general public, both within and outside Charles University.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <div style="color: gray">
  <p>
Students of Charles University can register for this course as an elective under
<a href="https://is.cuni.cz/studium/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&kod=NAIL141" class="yellow">NAIL141</a>
and, after successful completion, receive 3 credits.
This is a true beginner-level course, intended for all Charles University students (primarily outside the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics).
  </p>

  <p>
The course consists of four parts: an online course (Elements of AI), attendance at one in-person lecture, one homework assignment, and a final workshop.
  </p>

  <p>
The course capacity is limited (due to personnel constraints). You can also
complete the online course and attend the lectures even without enrolling into
the NAIL141 course (without receiving credits).
  </p>

  <p>
The information below applies to the Winter Semester 2025/2026; instructions for the Summer Semester 2025/2026 will be published at the start of that term (some things may change depending on the evaluation of the winter semester).

          (in which you will upload your course completion certificate).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      By attending a lecture of your choice, you will broaden your understanding of AI in a specific discipline (e.g., AI in healthcare, law, transport, or drone applications).  
      Only one lecture is required (though you are welcome to attend more).
      <ul>
        <li>
          You may choose a lecture freely, as long as it is part of a
          university course (e.g., AI in Context; but these are mostly in
          Czech), an academic conference, or AI Days.  
          If you wish to attend a different lecture, please contact us first to confirm it’s suitable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lectures titled <em>AI in Context</em> take place on some Thursdays at 17:30 at MFF UK, Malostranské náměstí 25, Prague 1.  
          More info under <a href="aivk_vyuka.html">Lectures</a>.
        </li>
      <li>You can find other AI events e.g. in the
          <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=prg.ai_4qhqlsn9aumu1d2bev6o2o02e4@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe/Prague">prg.ai calendar</a>
      </li>
        <li>Attending online lectures is also acceptable.</li>
        <li>
          Between November 3–16, many AI-related lectures and events take place across the Czech Republic as part of the
          <a href="https://www.dny.ai/">AI Days</a> festival.
          Attendance at one of these lectures also counts toward this course requirement.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please attend at least one AI-related lecture by December 19, 2025, and fill out the feedback form
          <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=2naS4DT5hkC_CIgWogQUon-HfqrM4h9JjjIfnQRr6CpUM0VOSDczOVJNS0NVRTlGUDYwS1pWN1I0Ry4u">AI_related_lecture</a>
          within 7 days after the lecture (later submissions will not be accepted).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      The homework assignment is a short reflection video (2–3 minutes).
      <ul>
        <li>
          The format of the video is up to your creativity.  
          It should present AI in the context of your field of study (or a related one).  
          Ideally, it should be inspired by the lecture you attended, but that is not mandatory.
        </li>
        <li>
          The video should clearly state a question you aim to answer — for example:  
          AI in medicine: What are the pitfalls of using smartwatch data?  
          AI in journalism: Does it make sense to employ journalists focused on stock markets?  
          <li>Present your question first, then provide your own reasoned answer.  
          <li>Your video will be shared only with a small group (approx. 5–7 students) as part of the workshop; it will not be shown publicly.  
          As preparation for the workshop, you will watch the videos of your groupmates and provide feedback.  
          <li>Please upload your video privately on YouTube and submit the link through the
          <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=2naS4DT5hkC_CIgWogQUon-HfqrM4h9JjjIfnQRr6CpUMk1OMjlRSklFUktaWEpBU000Q0NWTVE5NS4u">Homework_video form</a>
          by December 31, 2025.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      The final workshop serves to consolidate your knowledge and present your homework.
      <ul>
        <li>During the workshop, students will learn about topics explored by their peers, gaining insight into other areas of human activity.</li>

      
<li>
  We have set the dates as follows:
  <ul>
    <li>January 14, 13:00 – 16:00</li>
    <li>January 19, 12:00 – 15:00</li>
    <li>January 26, 12:00 – 15:00</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>
  Registration in SIS will be open from the end of December. The venue will most likely be
  MFF Charles University, Malostranske namesti 25, Prague.
</li>

<li>
  As part of the final workshop, you will work in groups and will be required to watch
  and comment on the videos of other participants. Videos for individual groups
  (approximately five) will be sent no later than three working days
  before the assessment date.
</li>

<li>
  You must register at least seven days before the date;
  and if necessary deregister no later than five days in advance
  (otherwise it would be difficult for us to form groups
  and for you to watch the videos in time).
</li>

<li>
  The introductory part of the final workshop will be in English,
  for the group work the language of each group may be Czech/Slovak/English as
  per agreement.
  Videos may be submitted in Czech, Slovak, or English.
</li>

<li>
  P.S. We are trying to align the dates listed above with their publication in SIS.
  If there are minor time discrepancies during scheduling,
  we apologize in advance and thank you for your understanding 🙂
</li>
      
      
      
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
This is the first time we are offering the course in this format, so we kindly ask for your patience and understanding if something is unclear. Thank you.
  </p>

  <p> 
For organisational reasons, students are asked to submit all materials in the same semester in which they wish to receive the credit. The workshop content and individual assignments may differ from one semester to another.
  </p>


<h3>Troubleshooting Problems with the Forms</h3>  
<p>If you’re unable to open or save the questionnaires, please contact your
faculty’s “IT department”, which can resolve the issue. Thank you.</p>
